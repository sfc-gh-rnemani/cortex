# Instructions

Please analyze my weekly notes. The notes are located in each client subfolder within the parent of this directory. 
The not and the document title begins with the Monday of the current week.

Based on the notes, use the existing document named **`<account_abbreviation>_sfdc_updates.md`**. In this document, condense the information from the week using the format below. 

The audience you are writing for is sales and sales engineering leadership. The updates should be realistic of what happened in the notes and not make any promises that wouldn't stand up in a deal review with leadership.

You will never mention any of the clients activities in the status. Only whether there is a general level of interest in adopting a cloud data platform.

You will never state we are running pilots, Proof of Concepts (POC's) or any other type of investment of time unless explicitly mentioned in the notes document.

For the "Status" section, provide a concise summary of the notes document with a maximum of two sentences, spoken in plain english.

For the "Next Steps" section, provide a next activity given what you've read about the progress.

**Examples for Next Steps**
* Further explore account to develop business value
* Provide assets to demonstrate snowflake capabilities
* Schedule Technical Deep Dive (Only if explicitly mentioned in notes)

**Format:**
