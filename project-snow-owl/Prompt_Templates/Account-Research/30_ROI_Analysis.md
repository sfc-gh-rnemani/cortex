## Account Value Realization Analysis for [COMPANY_NAME]
Analysis Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Analysis Period: [YYYY]

### Value Realization Analysis
| Category | Amount |
|----------|---------|
| Traditional Investment Value ($75/hr) | |
| AI Enhancement Investment ($0.0015/token) | |
| Net Value Realized | |

### Technology Enablement Metrics
Total Tokens Utilized: _____
Enhancement Rate: $0.0015/token

### Efficiency Metrics
Value Realization Factor: _____%
```

#### Calculation Steps

1. **Calculate Value Realization**
   ```python
   # Calculate value metrics
   traditional_value = baseline_hours * 75  # $75/hour
   enhancement_investment = total_tokens * 0.0015  # $0.0015 per token
   
   # Calculate value realized
   value_realized = traditional_value - enhancement_investment
   realization_factor = (value_realized / traditional_value) * 100
   ```

2. **Analyze Technology Enablement**
   ```python
   # Calculate enhancement metrics
   token_utilization = total_tokens
   enhancement_investment = token_utilization * 0.0015
   ```

## G2K ROI Analysis

### Purpose
This template provides instructions for creating a value realization analysis for implementing MCP-assisted account management across Snowflake's Global 2000 (G2K) customer accounts.

### Base Prompt

```
Act as a strategic business analyst specializing in value realization and efficiency optimization. Create a G2K value realization analysis for Snowflake's implementation of MCP-assisted account management using the following process:

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Focus on value creation, not cost reduction
- Track actual task durations
- Emphasize time optimization for strategic activities
- Highlight enhanced customer engagement opportunities
- Use "Value Realization" instead of "ROI" or "Savings"
- Avoid implying staff reductions
- Keep specific technology costs in detailed sections only

Context:
- Company: Snowflake
- Analysis Date: [TODAY'S_DATE]
- Implementation Period: [START_DATE] to [END_DATE]
- Target: Snowflake's Global 2000 (G2K) customer accounts
- Focus: Account Executive (AE) and Solutions Engineer (SE) time optimization
- Scope: All account documentation, planning, and strategic analysis activities

1. REQUIRED SECTIONS AND ORDER

| Strategic Impact | | | |

3. CALCULATION INSTRUCTIONS

Time Optimization:
```python
# Calculate optimization
traditional_hours = baseline_hours
ai_enhanced_hours = total_duration_minutes / 60
hours_optimized = traditional_hours - ai_enhanced_hours

# G2K scale calculations
total_traditional = traditional_hours * 2000
total_enhanced = ai_enhanced_hours * 2000
total_optimized = hours_optimized * 2000
```

Value Realization:
```python
# Value calculations
hourly_value = 75  # Standard rate
traditional_value = total_traditional * hourly_value
enhancement_value = total_enhanced * hourly_value
value_realized = traditional_value - enhancement_value

# Efficiency ratio
value_multiplier = traditional_value / enhancement_value
```

4. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

Phase Calculations:
```python
# Distribution of accounts
pilot_accounts = 50
phase1_accounts = 450
phase2_accounts = 750
phase3_accounts = 750

# Implementation timeline
pilot_duration = 1  # month
phase1_duration = 3  # months
phase2_duration = 4  # months
phase3_duration = 4  # months
